                In this article, Rosenzweig discusses the diverging accounts behind the origins of the Internet, outlining the limitations of each
                account and the implications behind the motives that may have driven their development.

                The sociocultural or contextualist approach describe the context of the years corresponding to the usual years associated with the birth of the Internet, namely the 60s,
                as an important clue: in those years was the Cold War and military tensions escalated between the US and Russia.

                Because of its perceived utility, the development of the Internet became an important motive as the need for the US military to stay at the top of the technology game
                grew by the years.

                Great Men Theories

                Competing with sociocultural theories of the origins of the Internet, such as the military establishment's role in budgeting and directing
                Internet technology, are other sources that recount the origins of the Internet such as Kathy Hafner and Matthew Lyon's book, Where Wizards
                Stay Up Late: The Origins of the Internet.
                in which great men are used to explain the development of the Internet.

                In this theory, Bolt Beraneck and Newman and their contract work with DARPA and DARPANET are attributed as one of the great independent variables
                leading to the successful development of Internet.

                Distributed Networks and Other Tech

                One of the most significant technologies developped that contributed to the Internet was packets.

                In the �70s, Canada envisaged to have its own Internet network which they called the Trans-Canada Computer Communications Network (TCCN).
                One of the chief concerns behind staying with the US based Internet was the fear that eventually the US would monopolize their share of the Internet-market, leaving Canadians with a lesser portion of its dividends.
                
                SCIENCE COUNCIL OF CANADA
                
                So the Science Council of Canada, in August 1971, drafted ideas about an Internet which would allow research computers to be linked at diverse universities with casual computers. This would allow engineers to work with other people at scale. The philosophy runs opposite to the ARPANET which was funded upon military concerns at a large scale.
                
                The TCCN called for a federated system�something akin to Hydro Quebec.
                
                POLITICAL INFLUENCES
                
                The author discusses the role that liberalism played in the �70s, and the influence of what was called �technological sovereignty�. The idea is described as an effort at the UN level to resist the idea that information should flow freely across borders in a way that these countries wouldn�t have any defence against the foreign American companies to come in and extract whatever data they were producing. The grounds for this level of concern were economic and social � Canadian national interest. The concern was that the network would serve national interest, not the other way around, to the forces of local and continental market forces. This relates to a kind of political structure and orientation that makes you think about the influences that can drive the development of technology that we take for granted.
                
                CONCERN OVER PRIVACY
                
                The concern over privacy of data is raised, even with the TCCN. Credit-rating agencies sell information about citizens� data, and there is a risk that potentially Canadian citizen�s data would be victimized under US-based interests of privatization and commodification of personal information.
                
                The idea was abandoned in 1973, moving towards incentive structures for Canada�s computer industry, such as preference for Federal contracts and import tariffs on foreign technology. A �96 paper mentioned there was a pushback from the provinces over the federal government, controlling the Internet. CANUnet too was abandoned in �72.
                
                PRESENT DAY ISSUES RELATED
                
                Now Cambridge Analytica show these issues weren�t unfounded. 
                NSA intercepted communication between users and corporate databases.
                Massive concentration of money and power from coroporations such as Micrsofot and Tencent. US or European coroporations reveal that they own the most profitable apps.
                
                Canada is still dependent on US-based companies like Facebook, Google.
                Some countries experiment with their own national initiatives for social media like Papua New Guinea that will try to block out Facebook for a month.

                SUMMARY imagining the use of computers in countercultural terms. In a 1995 Time Magazine, Stewart Brand argued that the personal computer revolution and the Internet had grown directly out 
                of counterculture (hippies). Decentralization and personalization + informationï¿½s transformative potential Esp. Telling of Apple Macintosh 1984, branded as a personal device to tear down bureaucracies and achieve intellectual freedom. 
                FIRST PHASE (1968-1972) Two Communities around Whole Earth Catalog Offices in Menlo Park. 1) Stanford Research Institute: Engineers preoccupied with human-computer integration 2) Whole Earth Catalog and its countercultural communities. Focused on the individual and collective transformation in a new communalist vein. SECOND PHASE Stewart turned to Gregory Bateson,
                who imagined the material world as an information system. They began to imagine a new kind of home for themselves--space colonies. THIRD PHASE In the late 70s, these ideas were ended and left place to the back-to-the-land movementï¿½s technophilia, and with it the collapse of New Communalism as a social movement.
