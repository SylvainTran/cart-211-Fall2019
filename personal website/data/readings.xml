                In this article, Rosenzweig discusses the diverging accounts behind the origins of the Internet, outlining the limitations of each
                account and the implications behind the motives that may have driven their development.

                The sociocultural or contextualist approach describe the context of the years corresponding to the usual years associated with the birth of the Internet, namely the 60s,
                as an important clue: in those years was the Cold War and military tensions escalated between the US and Russia.

                Because of its perceived utility, the development of the Internet became an important motive as the need for the US military to stay at the top of the technology game
                grew by the years.

                Great Men Theories

                Competing with sociocultural theories of the origins of the Internet, such as the military establishment's role in budgeting and directing
                Internet technology, are other sources that recount the origins of the Internet such as Kathy Hafner and Matthew Lyon's book, Where Wizards
                Stay Up Late: The Origins of the Internet.
                in which great men are used to explain the development of the Internet.

                In this theory, Bolt Beraneck and Newman and their contract work with DARPA and DARPANET are attributed as one of the great independent variables
                leading to the successful development of Internet.

                Distributed Networks and Other Tech

                One of the most significant technologies developped that contributed to the Internet was packets.

                In the 70s, Canada envisaged to have its own Internet network which they called the Trans-Canada Computer Communications Network (TCCN).
                One of the chief concerns behind staying with the US based Internet was the fear that eventually the US would monopolize their share of the Internet-market, leaving Canadians with a lesser portion of its dividends.

                SCIENCE COUNCIL OF CANADA

                So the Science Council of Canada, in August 1971, drafted ideas about an Internet which would allow research computers to be linked at diverse universities with casual computers. This would allow engineers to work with other people at scale. The philosophy runs opposite to the ARPANET which was funded upon military concerns at a large scale.

                The TCCN called for a federated system something akin to Hydro Quebec.

                POLITICAL INFLUENCES

                The author discusses the role that liberalism played in the 70s, and the influence of what was called technological sovereignty. The idea is described as an effort at the UN level to resist the idea that information should flow freely across borders in a way that these countries wouldn't have any defence against the foreign American companies to come in and extract whatever data they were producing. The grounds for this level of concern were economic and social Canadian national interest. The concern was that the network would serve national interest, not the other way around, to the forces of local and continental market forces. This relates to a kind of political structure and orientation that makes you think about the influences that can drive the development of technology that we take for granted.

                CONCERN OVER PRIVACY

                The concern over privacy of data is raised, even with the TCCN. Credit-rating agencies sell information about citizens' data, and there is a risk that potentially Canadian citizen's data would be victimized under US-based interests of privatization and commodification of personal information.

                The idea was abandoned in 1973, moving towards incentive structures for Canada's computer industry, such as preference for Federal contracts and import tariffs on foreign technology. A '96 paper mentioned there was a pushback from the provinces over the federal government, controlling the Internet. CANUnet too was abandoned in '72.

                PRESENT DAY ISSUES RELATED

                Now Cambridge Analytica show these issues weren't unfounded.
                NSA intercepted communication between users and corporate databases.
                Massive concentration of money and power from coroporations such as Micrsofot and Tencent. US or European coroporations reveal that they own the most profitable apps.

                Canada is still dependent on US-based companies like Facebook, Google.
                Some countries experiment with their own national initiatives for social media like Papua New Guinea that will try to block out Facebook for a month.

                SUMMARY imagining the use of computers in countercultural terms. In a 1995 Time Magazine, Stewart Brand argued that the personal computer revolution and the Internet had grown directly out
                of counterculture (hippies). Decentralization and personalization + informationï¿½s transformative potential Esp. Telling of Apple Macintosh 1984, branded as a personal device to tear down bureaucracies and achieve intellectual freedom.
                FIRST PHASE (1968-1972) Two Communities around Whole Earth Catalog Offices in Menlo Park. 1) Stanford Research Institute: Engineers preoccupied with human-computer integration 2) Whole Earth Catalog and its countercultural communities. Focused on the individual and collective transformation in a new communalist vein. SECOND PHASE Stewart turned to Gregory Bateson,
                who imagined the material world as an information system. They began to imagine a new kind of home for themselves--space colonies. THIRD PHASE In the late 70s, these ideas were ended and left place to the back-to-the-land movementï¿½s technophilia, and with it the collapse of New Communalism as a social movement.

                NET.ART was a term invented by Slovenian artist Vuk Cosic in 1995. The term became viral in the art forums existing at the time. Vuk Cosic and the early communities of artists strongly advocated a sense of collectivity or union. Online art was about communication. The article discusses the rise of .NET artists and somewhat iconic or cult-status websites such as Jodi.org, which helped establish new media based on the Internet. Russian artist Olia Lialina is one of the artists of that era who produced high-quality websites in terms of programming and used her work to recount somber themes.

                The article begins by recounting a fictional account of Facebook drama at UCLA Berkeley the which was a performance piece by Ed Fornieles. The term narrative on crack was used to display the kind of usage of this medium that this piece represented in the digital world. It consists of taking a prominent media platform and subverting it. These online narratives are sometimes taken to the physical world; the same artist, Ed Fornieles, sometimes builds sculptural frat-house sets matching his online narratives, that he then sells in the range of $5,000 to $17,000 to collectors or art agencies. The article highlights several physical museums that have started to display digital art. The Light and Wire Gallery in LA, and the Super Art Modern Museum in France host curated projects solely online. Transfer is another gallery that focuses on artists who are producing digital work. John Baldessari and ForYourArt produced In Still Life (2001-2010) which is an APP that allows users to create their own version of Abraham van Beyeren (1667) painting Banquet Still Life. This is somewhat unusual. The article discusses increased involvement at the institutional level. The Whitney for example, has been commissioning net art for its website for more than a decade. This spring, JODI created a 30-second animation that pops up on the site every day at sunrise and sunset. Rhizome's Seven on Seven, is an annual conference that pairs seven prominent artists and seven technologists for creative brainstorming sessions that sometimes result in works of art. Joe Hamilton collages digital graphics to create landscapes that are both synthetic and realistic Montreal-based Jon Rafman uses Google Maps to find unusual photographs and then displays these in a Tumblr blog. Various other artists are mentioned for having sold website art or other interesting mixes of internet pop culture with their work to collectors, sometimes in the thousands of dollars.

	The GNU manifesto defends the idea of sharing software for free. Richard Stallman, the creator of GNU, uses Kantian philosophy to advocate that selling licenses for the open use of software causes harm for society. The programmers are the most impacted by this legislative and financially-motivated capitalistic decision. Richard responds to several arguments against open-source software. One of the questions addressed is how would programmers
make a living if they do not get paid to sell software privately under a company or of their own action. The author of the manifesto points out that there are other ways to make money, such as selling handholding and other services instead of the product itself. The article also advocates that copying code is a natural thing for programmers, which is compared to the air that is breathed, and gives a comparison with ancient writers for which copying other authors' works was considered a good thing because it encouraged authorship. It was pointed out that the market sells license on intellectual property not because it is necessarily the right legislative action, but because it used to be that this encouraged creators of patents to share their work. In short, legislation is motivated by gains in some way, and there is no inherent argument for privatizing intellectual property against community sharing. Richard also points out that there are other kinds of rewards than money, such as social contribution. Finally, he mentions ways to collectively fund open-source software, like donations and citizens' freely-chosen tax funding.

In Gavin Mueller's article on Digital Proudhonism, we explore the ramifications of creative licensing and copyrighting. In particular, the author discusses the ideas of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, who lived about a century ago. His belief was that the artisan laborer is connected to the overall system of capitalism, by the way he produces his thing and exchanges it for something of similar value, thereby driving the whole machine whilst keeping ownership of his small-scale production. This would protect him from crime and external ownership that can drive the worst parts of capitalism and exploitation that we see today. Against this view is the focus on proletarian perspective on what works for capitalism, the proletariat selling the labor that they can give and nothing else. The work "The Philosophy of Poverty" is discussed further along these lines, stating that most exchanges are based on trading things of inequal value or exploitation. The article also funnily remarked that a grade school kid can have a copy of Photoshop and modify the face of George W. Bush to share with their friends freely in this day and age, something of a creative freedom that was propulsed over years of promoting computer shareware. What is really interesting to me is the idea that the Free Software movement, open-source free software, can become a catalyst for democratic progress and societal change. The motto seems to be, "everything is a remix".

(Presentation).
Ted Nelson wrote Computer Libs/Dreams as a way to retaliate in anger against things that didn't make sense.
It is a good example of a very radical product of counter culture thinking, and also a testament to some of its
inspirational powers.
Nelson saw computers, and specifically their potential for media as well as personal freedom, as a way
to emancipate the problems of the economy and society.
The 1960s were a very idealistic generation--Computer Libs/Dreams is one of the most iconic works of that time
which inspired successive generations of designers and programmers.
Project Xanadu in particular, which is discussed a little bit in the article, was pushed by Ted Nelson as the
solution to problems of restrained access to information. This was a time before the World Wide Web and text processors
were invented. The article is divided roughly in three parts: an introduction to what Computer Libs / Dreams
is (its double-sided format), the problems with the education system and the computer assisted instruction movement at the time,
fantics (informatics) and Thinkertoys.

In Thinkertoys, Nelson showcases his design concepts for the Parallel Textface, a part of the Xanadu Project.
In it he presents several human interaction principles that focuses on the simplicity of ease (user failsafe),
versioning systems, an extensive and intuitive user control system, and overall a way to compare several
texts from their source. The idea was to use computer display systems to aid or faciliate human thinking as
they go about solving complex problems in design and research or otherwise. The author is essentially pushing the idea of hypertext--clickable links, which would serve as the foundation
of the Xanadu Project. This idea was then adapted for the World Wide Web.
